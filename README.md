# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

# Project Summary -
The Credit Card Default Prediction project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card holder will default on their payment next month. The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and model evaluation.

The dataset used for the project contained various features related to credit card holders, such as their payment history, bill amounts, and demographic information. The target variable was a binary indicator of whether the customer defaulted on their payment in the following month.

The project began with Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data, understand feature distributions, and identify any patterns or correlations. data preprocessing, which involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data, understand feature distributions, and identify any patterns or correlations.

Next, several machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset. The models considered included Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost (XGB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Hyperparameter tuning was also performed for some models to optimize their performance.

The models were evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score. Additionally, undersampling techniques were applied to address the class imbalance issue in the dataset.

# Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to build a reliable predictive model that can accurately classify credit card holders as either likely to default or not likely to default on their payment next month.
